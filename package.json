  "description": "Documenting useful concepts and book reads. \r Currently includes useful code from the books:\r - [React Quickly](https://amzn.to/48HkBji) which comes with a website containing samples. \r - [ReactJS Foundations](https://amzn.to/3S6FRK7) is a good book to pair with  React Quickly as they both have different styles of information-sharing. I found the code herein to be a bit differently setup than the other book, but this was in fact one of the first newer books I've picked up for my learning. In the past, I also read\r - [React Up & Running](https://amzn.to/3NL8ude) which is also good. It's a quick read and covers the absolute essentials, but doesn't cover everything. You can finish this book in less than a week, while the other 2 books would take a few weeks if done in tandem with coding on a local system.",
