# react-samples
Documenting useful concepts and book reads. 
Currently includes useful code from the books:
- [React Quickly](https://amzn.to/48HkBji) which comes with a website containing samples. 
- [ReactJS Foundations](https://amzn.to/3S6FRK7) is a good book to pair with  React Quickly as they both have different styles of information-sharing. I found the code herein to be a bit differently setup than the other book, but this was in fact one of the first newer books I've picked up for my learning. In the past, I also read
- [React Up & Running](https://amzn.to/3NL8ude) which is also good. It's a quick read and covers the absolute essentials, but doesn't cover everything. You can finish this book in less than a week, while the other 2 books would take a few weeks if done in tandem with coding on a local system.

If I had the time, I would look into the other books:
- [React Interview Guide](https://amzn.to/47p0Ufh) is a new book with parallel [github repo](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/React-Interview-Guide)
- [Full-Stack Web Development with GraphQL and React](https://amzn.to/3NMqsvK)

Project plan
- [ ] Use create-react-app (CRA) to create and run a first sample App.
- [ ] Setup a basic project without using CRA - minimalist project to start with.
- [ ] Add on to add fun 'apps' like a Calculator, Timer, To-do list and filters, along with fetching and rendering the data. 
- [ ] Add links to the apps so they're easy to navigate i.e React Routers
- [ ] Visualization of this data using third-party libraries.
- [ ] Use Typescript examples as a seperate project, while starting with JS/JSX.
- [ ] Add a server that does something - looking into something like  GraphQL as I've been curious on how it pans out vs Sql-based RDBMS I've used for the most part (with the exception of MongoDB)
- [ ] Update Readme periodically  with a focus on important concepts. 
- [ ] Add other eco systems into the mix, Node.js, Next.js are defaults to start with.
